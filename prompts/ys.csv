A male samurai warrior in his early thirties with a strong and agile build, wearing a blue sleeveless kimono-style outfit with a high collar scarf that partially covers his face. His hair is long, dark brown, and tied into a high topknot ponytail flowing in the wind. His chest and right arm are bare, revealing a lean, muscular physique. His left arm is protected by ornate silver samurai armor with sharp, wing-like patterns. He wields a long, elegant katana with intricate engravings on the hilt, held loosely as if always ready to strike. His expression is calm yet intense, reflecting pain and pride — a wandering swordsman with a tragic past. A subtle scar crosses one side of his face, hinting at many battles fought. He wears traditional Japanese-inspired sandals and a belt with rope details. Character design must stay the same in all scenes. Consistent outfit, hair, facial structure, and accessories. 8K resolution, cinematic lighting, ultra-detailed texture, anime-realistic hybrid style. The samurai stands on a windy mountain cliff in Ionia, surrounded by red maple leaves falling through warm sunset light. His scarf flutters in the wind. His expression is calm and melancholic, as if carrying a heavy past. The camera slowly pans from the ground up to reveal his full figure. Mood: cinematic, epic, wandering swordsman, ultra-detailed texture, consistent character design across frames.
